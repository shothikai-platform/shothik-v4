PaperDebugger is an in-editor, multi‑agent academic writing assistant that lives inside Overleaf via a Chrome extension and performs diagnosis, rewriting, review, and literature retrieval directly on LaTeX documents.[1][2]

## What PaperDebugger does  
- Provides paragraph‑level diagnosis and automatic rewriting to improve clarity, coherence, and readability of academic text while preserving intent.[3][2]
- Offers structured review and scoring of papers, highlighting issues in argument flow, organization, and citation usage within the editor.[4][1]
- Supports literature search and reference lookup as part of the writing flow, so related work and citations can be pulled in without leaving Overleaf.[1][4]

## Overleaf integration  
- Runs as a Chrome extension that injects UI directly inside Overleaf rather than as a separate web app, enabling in‑place interaction with LaTeX documents.[2][5][1]
- Synchronizes with document state and revision history to create fine‑grained diffs and Git‑style before/after patches that users can accept or reject.[6][1]
- Uses a Kubernetes‑native backend plus a Model Context Protocol (MCP/XtraMCP) toolchain to orchestrate specialized agents and tools per document.[7][6][1]

## Core technical ideas  
- Employs a multi‑agent pipeline (Reviewer, Enhancer, Researcher, Scorer, etc.) that can run in parallel to critique, rewrite, fact‑check, and score sections.[8][1]
- Maintains secure state management and bidirectional syncing to support localized edits and diff‑based updates instead of blind whole‑file rewrites.[6][1]
- Exposes a plugin system so new tools (additional scorers, search backends, workflows) can be added without changing the core editor integration.[9][1]

## Getting started  
- Install the **PaperDebugger BETA** extension from the Chrome Web Store and connect it to Overleaf projects to enable in‑editor assistance.[2]
- Source code, documentation, website, and the research paper are available under the PaperDebugger GitHub organization.[10][11][1]
- Early deployments report active use by students and researchers preparing conference and journal submissions, with telemetry summarized in the demo paper.[4][1][6]

## If you want to build something similar  
- Implement an editor‑integration layer (browser extension or similar) that tracks cursor, selections, and a LaTeX/document model in real time.[5][1]
- Build a backend orchestration service that runs multi‑agent workflows (review, rewriting, search, scoring) with diffing and literature‑search tools, ideally over an MCP‑style protocol.[9][1][6]
- Design a minimal, low‑intrusion UI focused on inline suggestions, patch previews, and one‑click application of edits, borrowing from Git‑style workflows developers already understand.[8][1][2]
