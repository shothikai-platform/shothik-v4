4. **AI Agents** - Slide generation, data analysis/sheet generation, and deep research capabilities with real-time streaming.

The application is a Next.js 16 frontend that communicates with a separate backend API at `api-qa.shothik.ai`.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- **Next.js 16** with App Router for routing and server components
- **TypeScript** with relaxed strict mode (noImplicitAny disabled)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** for styling with CSS variables for theming

### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit** for global application state (auth, analytics, upload queues, slide editing, research chats)
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state and API data caching
- **RTK Query** for some API endpoints (presentation, research chat APIs)

### UI Component Strategy
- **Radix UI primitives** wrapped with **shadcn/ui** components (new-york style)
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **Tiptap** for rich text editing in paraphrase and content tools
- **Monaco Editor** for code editing features

### Key Architectural Patterns

1. **Service Layer Pattern** - Business logic lives in `/src/services/` (e.g., `marketing-automation.service.ts`, `plagiarism.service.ts`, `uploadService.js`)

2. **Custom Hooks for Features** - Complex features use custom hooks (e.g., `/src/hooks/presentation/` for slide editing, `/src/hooks/useAutoFreeze.js` for paraphrase)

3. **Redux Slices per Feature** - Each major feature has its own slice (`uploadQueueSlice`, `slideEditSlice`, `researchChatSlice`, `analyticsSlice`)

4. **Iframe Communication** - Slide editing uses postMessage for parent-iframe communication to isolate slide styles

5. **Streaming Data Handling** - Deep research and AI features use real-time streaming with Socket.io-client

### File Organization
```
src/
├── app/           # Next.js App Router pages and layouts
├── components/    # React components (ui/, tools/, presentation/)
├── hooks/         # Custom React hooks
├── redux/         # Redux store, slices, and RTK Query APIs
├── services/      # API communication and business logic

├── types/         # TypeScript type definitions
├── adapters/      # Data transformation adapters
└── config/        # Configuration constants and routes
```

### Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication stored in cookies
- Google OAuth integration via `@react-oauth/google`
- Middleware protects `/dashboard/*` routes, redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/login`

### Error Handling Strategy
- Error boundaries for component isolation (especially in slide editing)
- Custom error classes with user-friendly messages (e.g., `UploadError`)
- Toast notifications via centralized toast service

## External Dependencies

### Backend API
- Primary API: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (currently `api-qa.shothik.ai`)
- Endpoints for plagiarism detection, paraphrasing, AI detection, marketing automation, research

### Third-Party Services
- **Meta/Facebook Business API** - OAuth integration for ad publishing, page management, pixel tracking
- **Stripe** - Payment processing via `@stripe/stripe-js`
- **Cloudinary** - Image hosting (configured in next.config.ts)
- **ImageKit** - CDN for media assets (authentication via `getImageKitAuth`)
- **Google Vertex AI Search** - Used by backend for deep research grounding

### Real-time Communication
- **Socket.io-client** - Real-time updates for research streaming, wallet updates

### Analytics
- Google Analytics (gtag)
- Facebook Pixel
- Custom analytics slice with consent management
