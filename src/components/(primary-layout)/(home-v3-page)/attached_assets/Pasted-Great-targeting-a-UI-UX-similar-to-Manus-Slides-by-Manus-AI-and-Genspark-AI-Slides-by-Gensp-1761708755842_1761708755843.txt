Great — targeting a UI/UX similar to Manus Slides (by Manus AI) **and** Genspark AI Slides (by Genspark is a solid goal. Below are **detailed UI/UX design guidelines and architectural suggestions** that you and your team (for the project Presenton) can use to implement this. We’ll break it down into: *key design patterns*, *UX flows*, *frontend architecture considerations*, *backend integration*, and then *next-steps and checklist* for your dev team.

## Key Design Patterns & UI Elements

### 1. Clean, minimal-but-powerful layout

* Both Manus Slides and Genspark use large whitespace, minimal header/navigation clutter, and focus the “slide deck” or “slide preview” area centrally.
* Use a **slide-preview canvas on the right (or center)** and a **sidebar or left panel** for controls (prompt input, slide outline, settings).
* Ensure consistent typography: readable fonts, good contrast, light backgrounds with dark text or vice versa depending on theme.
* Unified color themes: let users pick a global theme (corporate, creative, minimalist) before generating — Genspark mentions tone selection. ([Medium][1])
* Provide **instant preview** of slide results as generation proceeds (e.g., “Streaming slides” or “live update” style) so the user sees progress.

### 2. Prompt + action first, editing second

* On Manus Slides: you input a simple prompt (“Create a presentation on …”) and it then builds the deck. ([Medium][2])
* On Genspark: similarly upload file or input topic, choose some settings, then the system builds. ([Medium][1])
* For your UI: start with **two big steps** — (a) Input/prompt/upload + settings, (b) Review/edit and export.
* The “slide section” UI needs to show:

  * Slide thumbnails in a vertical/horizontal strip (so user can click to edit any slide)
  * The large slide canvas where chosen slide is edited.
  * A toolbar/context panel for editing slide: layout, text, image, chart, theme.
* Include “Regenerate” or “Revise” functions: e.g., user wants to change tone, add slides, reorder.

### 3. Design controls & editing

* Allow drag-and-drop or easy repositioning of slide elements (text boxes, images, charts).
* A **layout selector**: grid of slide layouts (title + image, bullet list, chart, full-image, etc.).
* Theme/style picker: colors, fonts, global theme.
* Slide master editing: let user define a master style so all slides follow consistent design (Genspark emphasises slide theme consistency). ([Genspark][3])
* Import/upload support: upload image, video, chart data (CSV/Excel) so user can replace generative content.
* Export options: PPTX, PDF, share link (both noted in the competing tools). ([Skywork][4])
* Real-time preview of slide changes and quick toggles (e.g., show/hide background image, switch between 4:3 / 16:9 aspect ratio). Manus complaints included aspect ratio mismatch so support for ratio choice is important. ([Reddit][5])

### 4. Workflow flow & interactions

* On start: Show a prompt input field + upload file area.
* On submission: Show progress indicator (e.g., “Generating slides… 40% done”, “Rendering slide 3/12”)
* Once generated: Show slide thumbnails + canvas. First thumbnail selected automatically. Show “Edit this slide” button.
* Side panel: Outline of slides (titles), drag to reorder, add new slide, delete slide.
* Toolbar above canvas: Actions for layout, theme, image replace, text edit.
* Save/Export: prominent button (e.g., top right).
* Undo/Redo controls.
* Mobile/responsive version: Possibly collapse side panels.

## Frontend Architecture Considerations

Since you’re using a Next.js front-end (from your repo) and a FastAPI backend, here are some suggestions:

* Use **React functional components** with hooks for state (e.g., current slide index, slide data array).
* Introduce a **Redux store** or React Context for global state (deck metadata, theme, slides array).
* Use a component library or design system (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design) but theme it to your brand.
* Slide thumbnails should lazy-load; canvas should render the slide in high fidelity.
* For the slide canvas, use a **canvas or SVG-based editor** (e.g., react-konva or similar) so you can support drag/resize of elements.
* Ensure **optimistic UI updates**: when user edits, update local state first, then send save request to backend for persistence.
* Provide WebSocket or polling updates during generation so UI shows live progress.
* Accessibility: keyboard shortcuts for next/prev slide, duplicate slide (Ctrl D), etc (similar to Google Slides tips). ([Genspark][6])

---

## Backend Integration & Feature Support

* The front end should call your FastAPI endpoints for:

  1. Generate deck (input prompt/upload) → returns deck metadata + slide count + thumbnails previews or slide JSON.
  2. Edit slide elements (pass slide ID + changed element JSON) → backend persists.
  3. Export deck (PPTX/PDF) endpoint.
* Consider **jobs queue** (e.g., Celery + Redis) for long generation tasks; front end polls or WebSocket to track status.
* Store slide metadata in PostgreSQL (you already have PG metadata stack) with tables: `decks`, `slides`, `elements`.
* Store actual assets (images, PDFs) in GCP Storage.
* Maintain version history for slides (so users can revert).
* Use caching for templates and static assets.
* For style/theme templates, store them in DB or file system and allow front end to fetch list.
* Logging & monitoring: track generation success/fail rate, time taken.

## Next-Steps & Checklist for Your Team

1. **Design mockups**

   * Create high fidelity UI mockups for the slide section: thumbnail panel, canvas view, toolbar, side panel for editing.
   * Use tools like Figma and share with stakeholders for feedback.

2. **Define slide data model**

   * Decide on JSON schema for a slide: elements (type, position, size), layout type, background, theme.
   * Define API contract between frontend and backend.

3. **Implement UI scaffolding**

   * Implement the shell: thumbnail panel + canvas placeholder.
   * Integrate drag/resize library for slide elements.

4. **Connect generation endpoint**

   * Front end: wire prompt/upload input → call backend → receive slide data → load into UI.
   * UI: show progress bar while generating.

5. **Editing features**

   * Layout selector component.
   * Theme switcher.
   * Image replacement/upload.
   * Text editing inline.
   * Slide reorder/delete/add.

6. **Export & share**

   * Provide “Export as PPTX”, “Export as PDF”, “Share link” buttons.
   * Backend: generate and return file.

7. **User experience polish**

   * Undo/redo.
   * Keyboard shortcuts (duplicate slide, delete slide, etc).
   * Responsive/mobile support.
   * Loading states, error states.

8. **Theming and brand kit**

   * Allow users to import brand colors/fonts so slides align with their company style.
   * Provide preset themes (corporate, creative, education).

9. **Performance & scaling**

   * Optimize large image handling.
   * Use virtualized lists for thumbnails if decks are large.
   * Preload high-res slides only when selected.

10. **User testing & feedback loop**

    * Share early build with internal users.
    * Collect feedback specifically on slide UI/UX — ease of editing, clarity of controls, generation time.

If you like, I can **mock up a detailed UI sketch** (in Figma/diagram form) of the slide section for Presenton that combines the best of Manus & Genspark, and we can iterate together on the exact placement of controls, panels and workflows. Would you like me to prepare that?
