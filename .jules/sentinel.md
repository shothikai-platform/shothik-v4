## 2026-02-14 - [Information Disclosure via Update Operations]
**Vulnerability:** IDOR in update operation could return sensitive data even if the update payload was invalid or broken (e.g., mismatched field names).
**Learning:** Database update operations often return the document by default, creating an information disclosure risk even if no modification occurs.
**Prevention:** Always verify authorization (ownership) before performing database operations, even for seemingly harmless or broken updates.

## 2025-05-22 - [DoS Prevention via Input Validation]
**Vulnerability:** Resource exhaustion (Denial of Service) via unrestricted input text size and variant count in the NLP inference service.
**Learning:** ML inference services are particularly susceptible to DoS because processing large inputs or many variants consumes significant CPU and memory.
**Prevention:** Use Pydantic `Field` constraints to enforce strict length and range limits on all user-controlled inputs at the API gateway/routing layer.

## 2025-02-26 - [IDOR in Research Chat API]
**Vulnerability:** `get_one_chat` endpoint fetched chats by ID without verifying user ownership, allowing unauthorized access to other users' chats.
**Learning:** Checking authentication is not enough; authorization (ownership check) is mandatory for accessing user-specific resources.
**Prevention:** Always scope database queries with `userId` (e.g., `findOne({ _id: id, userId: currentUser._id })`) instead of just `findById(id)`.
